Website Code Explanation
This website is built using fundamental, 'vanilla' web technologies. It does not use any complex frameworks like React or Bootstrap.

Core Technologies:
HTML5: Used to build the entire structure and content of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and sections.

CSS3: Used for all the visual styling. This includes colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and making the website fully responsive so it looks good on all devices (mobiles, tablets, and desktops). Modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid were used to create the layout.

Key Characteristics:
Static Website: It is a single-page static site, meaning it doesn't have a backend or a database. It's fast and secure.

Custom Coded: Everything is written from scratch without relying on external libraries, making it lightweight and optimized.
